# Work Organisation
For this project, we worked at four (cf. contributors)

## Step 1 
------------------------------
The first important step was to understand the theorem, think about the different steps that would allow us to produce our visualization and agree on the final look. So we started by gathering as much informations as possible.

### Work from March 3 to March 26


- Understanding of the subject
theorem :

For that, it was necessary to understand well the evolution of the Aztec diamond figure then to understand the various stages of the paving related to the properties of the chessboard.

- Thinking about the script 
Idea :

After having understood the "mathematical aspect" , we thought about the different functions, packages... useful to succeed in transcribing the phenomenon of the Arctic circle in python. We ended up using numpy and pygame packages and we undertood the different steps of the paving process.

- Final result :

We want to create a package that generates the Aztec diamond. First, we want a visualization of the article circle.
Then, a documentation and an explanation of the phenomenon.
The goal is that everyone can understand in a simple way the Arctic circle theorem and visualize the Aztec diamond  

(README due March 26)

## Step 2
------------------------------

Using the previous research, we generated the random paving of an Aztec diamond .
For an n chosen beforehand, the paving is built under our eyes.

### Work from March 27 to April 16

 The different steps of the script : 

- Figure support  
- Class Domino
- Class Aztecdiamond

## Step 3

In this part, we worked on documentation, testing and user information..

### Work from April 17 to April 25
A review of the course was necessary. We spent some time to redo the practical exercises seen in the software development course. We also used youtube and Google to enrich our research.  We have written the practical information to download and use our package. We also reworked the documentation by expanding the comments and adding pictures and important results.


# Repartition of the tasks

Throughout the project, we worked together. We had zoom meetings every day.
During the last weeks, the work was more intensive, indeed we worked together at the library. It was difficult to allocate tasks to each other because the scripts is linked.
So we made the choice to do everything together. Even if it took longer.

For the beamer, we chose latex writing. Indeed, overleaf allowed us to work simultaneously. We divided the parts equally as follows:

- Christelle : Introduction and conclusion
- Anna : Numerical aspect
- Omar : Package information
- Sonia : Mathematical aspect
