# Work Organisation
For this project, we worked with four (cf. contributors)

## Step 1 
------------------------------
The first important step was to understand the subject and agree on the final look. So we started by gathering as much information as possible.

### Work from March 3 to March 26


- Understanding of the subject
theorem :

For that, it was necessary to understand well the figure "aztec diamond" then to understand the various stages of the paving related to the properties of the chessboard.

- Reflection about the script 
reflection :

After having understood the "mathematical aspect", we thought about the different functions, library... useful to succeed in transcribing the phenomenon of the circle article in python.

- Final result :

We want to create a package that generates the aztec diamond. First, we want a visualization of the article circle.
Then, a documentation and an explanation of the phenomenon.
The goal is that everyone can understand in a simple way and visualized the theorem of the diamond aztec

(README due March 26)

## Step 2
------------------------------

Using the previous research, we generated the random paving of a diamond astec.
For an n chosen beforehand, the paving is built under our eyes.

### Work from March 27 to April 16

 The different steps of the script : 

- Figure support  
- Class Domino
- Class Aztecdiamond

## Step 3

In this part, we worked on documentation, testing and user information..

### Work from April 17 to April 25
A review of the course was necessary. We spent some time to redo the practical exercises seen in the software development course. We wrote the practical information for downloading and using the package. We also reworked the documentation by expanding the comments and adding pictures and important results.


# Repartition of the tasks

Throughout the project, we worked together. We had zoom meetings every day.
During the last weeks, the work was more intensive, indeed we worked together at the library. It was difficult to allocate tasks to each other because the scripts were linked.
So we made the choice to do everything together. However if it took longer.

For the beamer, we chose the writing in Latex. Indeed overleaf allowed us to work simultaneously. We divided the parts equally as follows:

-  Christelle : Introduction an conclusion
- Anna : Numerical aspect
- Omar : Package information
- Sonia : Mathematical aspect
