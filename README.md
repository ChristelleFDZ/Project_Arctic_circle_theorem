#### <font color="blue">Aztec Diamond </font>

In combinatorial mathematics, Aztec diamond of order n, is the set of all squares of square network whose centers (x,y) satisfy | x | + | y | ≤ n. 

We will work with the squares of colored diamond in chessboard.

Here is an example of Aztec diamond of order 1, 2, 3 and 6.

#### <font color="blue">Random paving </font>

Now, we are interested in paving this figure.
We are going to tile our Aztec diamond using dominoes. The rules of the paving are as follows:
- firstly, our dominoes have to completely fill our figure,
- secondly, they must not overlap 
- and finally, don't come out of the figure.
There are a very large number of possible ways to place them. Indeed, for an Aztec Diamond of order n, there are 2^n(n+1)/2 several tilings.

To represent different paving, we will use a color convention that allows to distingue 4 possibilities of placement for a domino. 
A horizontal domino with a white square on the right is represented by a clear blue domino.
A horizontal domino with a white square on the left is represented by a green domino.
A vertical domino with a white square at the bottom is represented by a yellow domino.
A vertical domino with a black square at the bottom is represented by a red domino.

Nous pouvons nosu demander si a grand echelle il existe un arrangement typique de pavages ?
