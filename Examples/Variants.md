If you want to see other variants of the arctic circle theorem and more exotic use of this magical theorem here are some examples:

In fact, you can even have fun assigning weights based on the pixel intensity of a photograph. This is what it gives:

### <font color="purple"> Other random tilings </font>

It is also possible to make tilings with shapes other than dominoes using the tiling algorithm: for example, tiling a hexagon with diamonds. The idea is to replace the set of squares, which is in a way the "skeleton" of the Aztec diamond, by another regular set of geometric figures: the hexagonal lattice (top right), the square-octagon lattice (bottom left) , or the network made up of squares, hexagons and octagons (bottom right).

A typical hexagon tiling using diamonds reveals a phenomenon similar to the arctic circle in the Aztec diamond.

The other networks presented above give rise to tilings in which simultaneously appear tiles of different shapes (squares, triangles, etc.). The following figure shows two random tilings obtained from these networks (with details of the tilings inside the disks).

*A phenomenon of edge freezing is again observed on these pavings, but the shape of the frozen part is not identified yet.*
