## Time and Memory


Our project allows us to simulate the paving of an Aztec diamond of size 200.
For each iterations, which will correspond to the passage from size n to size n + 1, the animation generates 3 images : 

- Creation of the aztec diamond size n + 1
- Removal of badly positioned dominoes
- Coloring dominoes according to their position.
